##### PopoverMenu is constructed out of trigger element and content element.

Popovers content position and floating behaviour can be controlled with props `fixed`, `flip`, `appendTo` and `placement`. All of this is explained in `<Popover>` examples which will work in PopoverMenu same as in Popover.
