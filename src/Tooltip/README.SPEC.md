# `<Tooltip/>`

## Issues with the current Tooltip

- Uses our own naive positioning mechanism, [which](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react/issues/2754) [has](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react/issues/2596) [several](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react/issues/2582) [issues](https://github.com/wix/wix-style-react/issues/2069). The mechanism is not at mature and community backed as [`Popper.js`](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js).
- Can be both Controlled and Uncontrolled, leads to confusion.
- Does not follow the UX guidelines:
  - A tooltip should only be opened on HOVER, currently the consumers can set the triggering
    events.
  - A tooltip should only contains textual content, currently it can accept any node.
  - Our `<Tooltip/>` could be used as Popover (opens on click), leads to confusion.
  - The Tooltip should has a `dark` theme, currently it's defaulted to a `light` theme.

## The solution

> Update the `<Tooltip/>` component according to the UX guidelines and improve its positioning mechanism.

This "mechanism" is ready, and it's called `<Popover/>`. This is a controlled component that uses
the `Popper.js` library to handle positioning.

### What's next about `<Tooltip/>`

The plan is to create a **new** `<Tooltip/>`. As discussed, it should:

- Use the `<Popper/>` component for positioning;
- Be **Uncontrolled**, and **only open on HOVER**, as per the UX guidelines;
- Has a `dark` theme by default (and the theme cannot be changed);
- Has a slimmer API;
- Provides clear documentation on how to achieve various way of positioning.
- Uses UniDriver.

### General Guidelines for Users

The `Tooltip` pattern is intended to contain text-only content,
and the `Popover` pattern is intended for tooltips with interactive content.

Avoid putting complex structured text content (e.g. with headings, bullet lists, etc) in a Tooltip. For anything mildly complex/structured, it'd be best for authors to go for a Popover.

### Basic usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Button from 'wix-style-react/Button';
import Tooltip from 'wix-style-react/Tooltip';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <Tooltip placement="top" content="This content explains buttons meaning.">
      <Button>Hover on me to see my meaning</Button>
    </Tooltip>
  </div>
);

export default MyComponent;
```

### Accessibility & Keyboard Navigation

A tooltip is a popup that displays information related to an element when the element receives keyboard focus or the mouse hovers over it. It typically appears after a small delay and disappears on blur or mouse leave.

Neil example: https://codepen.io/WW3/pen/BQzEKE?editors=1000

- Pressing TAB will focus Button and open Tooltip.
  - Pressing TAB again will blur the component and close the Tooltip.

### Migration plan

We'll use the `upgrade` prop method like we did for the new `<Button/>`. We'll deprecate the "old" `<Tooltip/>` and remove it completely in the next major Version (V7? üôè).
