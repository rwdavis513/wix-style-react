# Migration to new Tooltip API

## TL;DR

- react/enzyme testkit is now _async_ !

## Why API as changed

Tooltip issues:

- uses in-house built positioning mechanism, which has several issues.
- does not follow the UX guidelines.
- is confusing because can be controlled and uncontrolled.

> wix-style-react 6 by default will support previous Tooltip API. New Tooltip API can be enabled with prop `upgrade`. Next major version (7) will only support new API.

## New Tooltip features

- Is Uncontrolled, and only open on HOVER, as per the UX guidelines.
- Uses community backed positioning mechanism `Popper.js`.
- Has a slimmer API.
- Provides clear documentation on how to achieve various way of positioning.
- Uses unidriver.
