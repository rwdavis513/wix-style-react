# `<Avatar/>`

Avatar is a type of element that visually represents a user, either as an image, placeholder or text (name initials).

If more than one of these props is supplied (with `name` prop giving default value to the text` prop), then the resolved content type for display goes according to this priority: image -> icon -> text.
