Use `type` prop to set how `<Notification/>` should be displayed:

* `type="global"` will take up space and push the content down.

* `type="local"` will not take up space and will be displayed on top of content

* `type="sticky"` will not take up space and will be displayed at the top of whole page and on top of content (`position: fixed;`)
