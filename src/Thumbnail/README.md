Component for displaying thumbnails.

Wix style thumbnails are usually of two types:
  1. component with image, title and subtitle
  2. component with image and optional title under image

Both can be done by using this component.

By default Thumbnail fills parent container space, thus ensure there are some dimensions set.
Otherwise, you can wrap Thumbnail in `<Proportion/>` or use `width` and `height` props.
